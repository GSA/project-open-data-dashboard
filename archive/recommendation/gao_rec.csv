024,GAO-10-13,Department of Homeland Security,310672,"To better ensure the successful delivery of a comprehensive US-VISIT exit solution, GAO augments its prior recommendations aimed at strengthening Comprehensive Exit project planning. The Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the Undersecretary for National Protection and Programs to have the US-VISIT Program Director develop and maintain an integrated master schedule for the Comprehensive Exit project in accordance with the nine practices discussed in this report.","In March 2013, pursuant to the explanatory statement for Department of Homeland Security&#39;s (DHS) 2013 appropriation, DHS re-assigned the responsibilities of the US-VISIT program to other organizations within DHS. For example, DHS transferred US-VISIT&#39;s overstay analysis function to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. DHS also created the Office of Biometric Identity Management within the National Protection and Programs Directorate, which assumed US-VISIT&#39;s previous responsibility for managing systems for tracking and matching arrival and departure records for the purpose of identifying potential overstays, and for maintaining biometric information that DHS collects from nonimmigrants upon their entry into the United States. DHS also assigned U.S. Customs and Border Protection&#39;s (CBP) Office of Field Operations with responsibility for coordinating DHS&#39;s entry and exit policies and operations, including developing and maintaining the integrated master schedule for the department&#39;s biometric exit program. In September 2014, CBP provided its updated integrated master schedule for exit projects within the Office of Field Operation&#39;s Entry/Exit Transformation Office. However, our analysis of the updated schedule identified weaknesses in the use of scheduling best practices. For example, roughly two-thirds of the schedule was missing logical relationships called dependencies that are needed to depict the sequence in which activities occur. Because a logic relationship dictates the effect of an on-time, delayed, or accelerated activity on subsequent activities, any missing or incorrect logic relationship is potentially damaging to the entire network. Complete network logic between all activities is essential if the schedule is to correctly forecast the start and end dates of activities within the plan. In addition, CBP did not provide any reviews of the quality of the schedule, performed by either the program office or by an outside group, to assess the use of best practices. We will continue to evaluate the CBP&#39;s progress in implementing this recommendation."
029,GAO-10-579,Department of Veterans Affairs,310941,"To enhance VA's effort to successfully fulfill its forthcoming plans for the outpatient scheduling system replacement project and the HealtheVet program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct the CIO to adhere to the department's guidance for system testing including (1) performing testing incrementally and (2) resolving defects of average and above severity prior to proceeding to subsequent stages of testing.","In written comments on our report, VA concurred with this recommendation and stated that testing is managed using documented, repeatable processes that are included in the ProPath Web-based tool. According to the Acting Deputy Chief Information Officer for Product Development, the new Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) project is expected to incorporate Agile software development practices, including the use of incremental testing. However, the MASS project is still being planned and has not yet reached the point where adherence to the department&#39;s system testing guidance can be assessed."
029,GAO-10-579,Department of Veterans Affairs,310941,"To enhance VA's effort to successfully fulfill its forthcoming plans for the outpatient scheduling system replacement project and the HealtheVet program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct the CIO to ensure implementation of a requirements management plan that reflects leading practices for requirements development and management. Specifically, implementation of the plan should include analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, verifiable, and sufficiently detailed to guide development, and maintaining requirements traceability from high-level operational requirements through detailed low-level requirements to test cases.","In written comments on our report, VA concurred with this recommendation and in August 2014, identified initial actions the department had taken in response. Specifically, as part of its plans to issue a request for proposals to acquire a replacement scheduling system under its Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) project, VA developed a Business Requirements Document that defines its specific business needs, capabilities, features, and constraints. Additionally, the department reported that it intends to manage and document requirements using processes supported by a Web-based tool called ProPath. However, the MASS project is currently being planned and has not yet reached the point where the effectiveness of the requirements management activities we recommended can be assessed."
029,GAO-10-579,Department of Veterans Affairs,310941,"To enhance VA's effort to successfully fulfill its forthcoming plans for the outpatient scheduling system replacement project and the HealtheVet program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct the CIO to ensure that the policies and procedures VA is establishing to provide meaningful program oversight are effectively executed and that they include (1) robust collection methods for information on project costs, benefits, schedule, risk assessments, performance metrics, and system functionality to support executive decision making; (2) the establishment of reporting mechanisms to provide this information in a timely manner to department IT oversight control boards; and (3) defined criteria and documented policies on actions the department will take when development deficiencies for a project are identified.","The Department of Veterans Affairs concurred with this recommendation and identified initial actions it has taken in response. For example, the agency instituted its Project Management Accountability System as a management approach to addressing performance issues with IT projects. In addition, the agency has begun to use ProPath to identify and document key systems development life-cycle processes. As part of this project management approach, in June 2014, the department completed a milestone review that formally initiated planning for its Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) project. However, because the project is still in its planning stage, the extent to which VA is providing the meaningful oversight we recommended cannot yet be assessed."
029,GAO-10-579,Department of Veterans Affairs,310941,"To enhance VA's effort to successfully fulfill its forthcoming plans for the outpatient scheduling system replacement project and the HealtheVet program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct the CIO to identify risks related to the scheduling project moving forward and prepare plans and strategies to mitigate them.","The Department of Veterans Affairs concurred with our recommendation and, in August 2014, pointed to certain actions it had taken. For instance, the Acting Deputy Chief Information Officer for Product Development stated that the department had instituted the use of its Project Management Accountability System and its ProPath Web-based tool to identify, track, and mitigate risks related to the department&#39;s effort to replace its scheduling system. The department also created a risk register for its Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) project. However, the project is currently being planned and has not yet reached the point where the effectiveness of the department&#39;s risk management activities can be assessed."
029,GAO-10-579,Department of Veterans Affairs,310941,"To enhance VA's effort to successfully fulfill its forthcoming plans for the outpatient scheduling system replacement project and the HealtheVet program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to ensure acquisition plans document how competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained or identify the basis of authority for not using full and open competition.","In written comments on our report, VA concurred with this recommendation and stated that it would work closely with contracting officers to ensure future acquisition plans clearly identify an acquisition strategy that promotes full and open competition. As noted in a July 2014 written response to questions from the acquisition community about the Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) project, the department&#39;s acquisition strategy has not yet been determined and it is reviewing all possible acquisition strategies. Thus, VA&#39;s acquisition planning has not yet reached the point where we can effectively assess the department&#39;s efforts to seek, promote, and sustain competition."
024,GAO-10-860,Department of Homeland Security,310688,"To the extent that the limitations in the Air Exit Pilots are not addressed through other information sources, the Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs to have the US-VISIT Program Director identify additional sources for the operational impacts of air exit not addressed in the pilots' evaluation and to incorporate these sources into its air exit decision making and planning.","In May 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported internally on the results of the DHS Science and Technology Directorate&#39;s analysis of previous US-VISIT air exit pilot programs and assessment of available biometric technologies. Among other things, the report discussed DHS&#39;s plans to implement several recommendations that have the potential to result in additional information sources to assess the operational impacts of a biometric air exit capability on stakeholders (e.g. airports, airlines, and travelers). These additional information sources may include a new biometric air exit concept of operations, developmental scenario testing to validate the concept of operations, operational tests to validate performance, and development of an evaluation framework for biometric air exit. However, the report also cited significant remaining questions, such as those regarding the current performance of the biographic air exit process, the comparative value of adding a biometric capability to the existing air exit process, and the overall value and cost of a biometric air exit capability. In September 2014, officials from DHS&#39;s U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that the agency was in the process of finalizing a report that is intended to assess the current state of the biometric exit environment, as well as a provide a gap analysis. According to agency officials, this report is expected to identify the strengths and possible gaps of biometric accountability of travelers across all modes of travel into and out of the United States, and the resulting findings are planned to be incorporated to the agency&#39;s entry/exit strategy as appropriate. Officials stated that these efforts are expected to be completed by January 1, 2015. We will continue to evaluate the department&#39;s progress implementing our recommendation."

First, the departments established the Interagency Program Office (IPO) advisory board in October 2011 to monitor the integrated electronic health record (iEHR) program&#39;s progress toward meeting cost, schedule, and performance milestones. However, the advisory board did not meet after June 2013 and was disbanded as a result of the departments&#39; decision to pursue separate modernizations of their electronic health record systems. Second, in August 2012, the departments established a working group under the Interagency Clinical Informatics Board to identify potential health IT investments for the departments to consider for joint adoption. However, the group has not met since June 2013, and according to DOD and VA officials, its activities have been suspended while the departments continue to define their separate modernization efforts and their electronic health data interoperability needs. Moreover, the group was not involved in helping the departments identify and select the separate electronic health record investments DOD and VA now plan to undertake to meet their common health care business needs. Because DOD and VA have not implemented a process for identifying and selecting joint IT investments, the departments have not demonstrated that their approach to meeting their common health care business needs has considered the costs, benefits, schedule, and risks of planned investments. As a result, VA and DOD lack reasonable assurance that they are pursuing the most cost-effective and timely course of action for delivering a fully interoperable electronic health record to provide the best possible care for service members and veterans."
007,GAO-11-265,Department of Defense,310960,"To ensure that DOD and VA efficiently and effectively modernize their electronic health record systems to jointly address their common health care business needs, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs should direct the Joint Executive Council to further develop the departments' joint health architecture to include their planned future (i.e., ""to be"") state and a sequencing plan for how they intend to transition from their current state to the next generation of electronic health record capabilities.","The Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) have not further developed a joint health architecture that could guide their efforts to address their common health care business needs, as GAO recommended in February 2011. The departments had undertaken certain actions, but these have been overtaken by events or are tangential to developing the architecture; thus progress in addressing GAO&#39;s recommendation has slowed. For example, in January 2013, the Interagency Program Office (IPO) developed an Enterprise Architecture Management Plan to provide guidance for developing joint architecture products, identify architecture governance bodies and stakeholder responsibilities, and propose high-level timelines for architecture-related activities. However, according to DOD and VA officials, this plan is no longer operative because it does not reflect the departments&#39; decision to pursue separate electronic health record system modernization efforts. In addition, in December 2013 the departments revised the charter of their IPO, which describes the importance of identifying and adopting health information technology (IT) standards to seamlessly integrate DOD and VA health care record data. The charter also specifies that the IPO is responsible for working with the departments&#39; Health Architecture Review Board to ensure that both departments are appropriately synchronized and coordinated. While these recent activities are peripherally related to development of the joint health architecture, DOD and VA have not yet developed architecture artifacts that describe their planned future state and how they intend to transition to that future state. Until the departments have an understanding of the common business processes and technologies that a joint health architecture can provide, they will continue to lack an essential tool for jointly addressing their common health IT needs."
007,GAO-11-265,Department of Defense,310960,"To ensure that DOD and VA efficiently and effectively modernize their electronic health record systems to jointly address their common health care business needs, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs should direct the Joint Executive Council to revise the departments' joint strategic plan to include information discussing their electronic health record system modernization efforts and how those efforts will address the departments' common health care business needs.","In March 2013, the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) released their joint strategic plan for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, as GAO recommended in February 2011. The plan described the departments&#39; intentions to pursue a single electronic health record system. However, 1 month earlier, in February 2013, the departments abandoned the single system approach and now intend to separately modernize their electronic health record systems. As a result, the plan&#39;s discussion of the single-system effort is no longer relevant. In July 2013, the VA/DOD Joint Executive Council tasked the DOD and VA Interagency Program Office with preparing an addendum to the joint strategic plan that would reflect the departments&#39; revised joint activities, milestones, metrics, and timelines for creating an interoperable health record. Yet, while the departments have begun their separate electronic health record modernization efforts and have identified the need to make these systems interoperable, they have not revised their plan for doing so. According to DOD and VA officials, as of January 2014, a draft addendum to the joint strategic plan was being reviewed by the departments&#39; senior leaders, but the officials could not say when the addendum is to be finalized.

029,GAO-11-265,Department of Veterans Affairs,310960,"To ensure that DOD and VA efficiently and effectively modernize their electronic health record systems to jointly address their common health care business needs, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs should direct the Joint Executive Council to define and implement a process, including criteria that considers costs, benefits, schedule, and risks, for identifying and selecting joint IT investments to meet the departments' common health care business needs.","The Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) initiated, but did not sustain, two courses of action that were potentially responsive to GAO&#39;s February 2011 recommendation; thus, progress in addressing GAO&#39;s recommendation has slowed. First, the departments established the Interagency Program Office (IPO) advisory board in October 2011 to monitor the integrated electronic health record (iEHR) program&#39;s progress toward meeting cost, schedule, and performance milestones. However, the advisory board did not meet after June 2013 and was disbanded as a result of the departments&#39; decision to pursue separate modernizations of their electronic health record systems. Second, in August 2012, the departments established a working group under the Interagency Clinical Informatics Board to identify potential health IT investments for the departments to consider for joint adoption. However, the group has not met since June 2013, and according to DOD and VA officials, its activities have been suspended while the departments continue to define their separate modernization efforts and their electronic health data interoperability needs. Moreover, the group was not involved in helping the departments identify and select the separate electronic health record investments DOD and VA now plan to undertake to meet their common health care business needs. Because DOD and VA have not implemented a process for identifying and selecting joint IT investments, the departments have not demonstrated that their approach to meeting their common health care business needs has considered the costs, benefits, schedule, and risks of planned investments. As a result, VA and DOD lack reasonable assurance that they are pursuing the most cost-effective and timely course of action for delivering a fully interoperable electronic health record to provide the best possible care for service members and veterans."
029,GAO-11-265,Department of Veterans Affairs,310960,"To ensure that DOD and VA efficiently and effectively modernize their electronic health record systems to jointly address their common health care business needs, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs should direct the Joint Executive Council to further develop the departments' joint health architecture to include their planned future (i.e., ""to be"") state and a sequencing plan for how they intend to transition from their current state to the next generation of electronic health record capabilities.","The Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) have not further developed a joint health architecture that could guide their efforts to address their common health care business needs, as GAO recommended in February 2011. The departments had undertaken certain actions, but these have been overtaken by events or are tangential to developing the architecture; thus progress in addressing GAO&#39;s recommendation has slowed. For example, in January 2013, the Interagency Program Office (IPO) developed an Enterprise Architecture Management Plan to provide guidance for developing joint architecture products, identify architecture governance bodies and stakeholder responsibilities, and propose high-level timelines for architecture-related activities. However, according to DOD and VA officials, this plan is no longer operative because it does not reflect the departments&#39; decision to pursue separate electronic health record system modernization efforts. In addition, in December 2013 the departments revised the charter of their IPO, which describes the importance of identifying and adopting health information technology (IT) standards to seamlessly integrate DOD and VA health care record data. The charter also specifies that the IPO is responsible for working with the departments&#39; Health Architecture Review Board to ensure that both departments are appropriately synchronized and coordinated. While these recent activities are peripherally related to development of the joint health architecture, DOD and VA have not yet developed architecture artifacts that describe their planned future state and how they intend to transition to that future state. Until the departments have an understanding of the common business processes and technologies that a joint health architecture can provide, they will continue to lack an essential tool for jointly addressing their common health IT needs."
029,GAO-11-265,Department of Veterans Affairs,310960,"To ensure that DOD and VA efficiently and effectively modernize their electronic health record systems to jointly address their common health care business needs, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs should direct the Joint Executive Council to revise the departments' joint strategic plan to include information discussing their electronic health record system modernization efforts and how those efforts will address the departments' common health care business needs.","In March 2013, the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) released their joint strategic plan for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, as GAO recommended in February 2011. The plan described the departments&#39; intentions to pursue a single electronic health record system. However, 1 month earlier, in February 2013, the departments had abandoned the single system approach and now intend to separately modernize their electronic health record systems. As a result, the plan&#39;s discussion of the single-system effort is no longer relevant. In July 2013, the VA/DOD Joint Executive Council tasked the DOD and VA Interagency Program Office with preparing an addendum to the joint strategic plan that would reflect the departments&#39; revised joint activities, milestones, metrics, and timelines for creating an interoperable health record. However, while the departments have begun their separate electronic health record modernization efforts and have identified the need to make these systems interoperable, they have not revised their plan for doing so. According to DOD and VA officials, as of January 2014, a draft addendum to the joint strategic plan was being reviewed by the departments&#39; senior leaders, but the officials could not say when the addendum is to be finalized. Until DOD and VA provide a revised plan that reflects their current approach, the departments and their stakeholders may not have a shared understanding of how they intend to address their common health care business needs going forward."

Among other things, the policy should address the development and implementation of an overarching taxonomy and associated ontologies to help ensure that each of the respective portions of the architecture will be properly linked and aligned. In addition, the policy should address alignment and coordination of business process areas, military department and defense agency activities associated with developing and implementing each of the various components of the BEA, and relationships among these entities.","The Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) approved the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) Configuration Control Board (CCB) charter on August 19, 2013. The charter specifies roles and responsibilities for the review and approval of proposed BEA content. However, the charter does not clarify the roles, responsibilities, and relationships among the Chief Management Officer, DCMO, Department of Defense (DOD) and military department Chief Information Officers (CIO), Principal Staff Assistants, military department Chief Management Officers, and the heads of the military departments and defense agencies, associated with the development of a federated BEA.

In addition, existing and future responsibilities may shift as a result of planned organizational changes. Specifically, on December 4, 2013, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum that outlined the results of an organizational review completed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Among other things, the Secretary called for strengthening the office of the DOD CIO by moving the oversight of business systems from the DCMO to the CIO, and for strengthening the Office of the DCMO to better coordinate the department&#39;s business affairs.

For example, the department has been integrating information contained in its system data repositories by developing and implementing the DOD Information Technology Investment Portal (DITIP). DITIP is now the authoritative source for DOD header (i.e., basic) information about information technology (IT) systems and is to serve as a one stop source for all IT investment portfolio information. More specifically, the system maintains a core database composed of common DOD IT Portfolio Repository (DITPR) and Select and Native Programming Data Input System - Information Technology (SNAP-IT) data elements as well as essential data elements required for initial registration of DOD IT systems (e.g., investment title, mission area, etc.). According to DOD, the portal addresses common data errors and integrates data between the portal and the DITPR and SNAP-IT system data repositories. In addition, DCMO&#39;s fiscal year 2014 investment management guidance included language indicating that the component Pre-Certification Authority is to assert that information contained in DITPR, DITIP, and SNAP-IT has been verified to be complete and accurate prior to any system&#39;s certification to spend appropriated funds. While this new approach has allowed DOD to improve certain information about its business system certification and approvals, other information needs continued improvement. Specifically, data contained in DITPR is not always consistent with DITIP and SNAP-IT. DOD officials stated that they plan to conduct a data validation process intended to align and reconcile the data common to DITPR and SNAP-IT via DITIP, but have not provided evidence that this validation process has been completed."

More specifically, the report stated that the Defense Business Council (DBC) did not certify $188 million in requests for development/modernization funds and that it conditionally certified $563 million in development/modernization requests pending DBC review and approval of documentation associated with analyzing business problems, capability gaps, or opportunities. The annual report also stated that DBC conducted quality checks and identified more than 300 systems at risk of not being certified for fiscal year 2014 due to insufficient Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) compliance assessments. According to the report, additional assistance was provided to ensure that the compliance assessment quality improved and subsequently all identified risks among systems were resolved. In addition, the office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated a sample of BEA assertions and identified concerns associated with 13 of the 15 that it validated. For example, according to the office of the DCMO, 9 of the 13 had inconsistencies in the organizational execution plan or had significantly incomplete compliance assertions in the BEA Compliance System. According to DOD officials, some of these concerns were addressed prior to system certification. They further stated that no systems were denied funding certification due to incomplete BEA compliance assertions because the Office of the DCMO worked with the components to address the issues to the satisfaction of the DBC prior to certification. Where additional action was needed, action items were created and DCMO is tracking the progress of these systems efforts to become compliant. However, information about these detailed assessments and actions taken to resolve them was not reported. In addition to including some information about systems that were conditionally or not certified due to weaknesses in their BPR documentation, the report also included summary information about known BPR weaknesses based on a DBC-level effort to validate a sample of BPR assertions for systems that were submitted for certification. For example, the annual report stated that 12 systems were evaluated for BPR compliance, and these evaluations concluded that more needed to be done to improve program execution of BPR compliance requirements. More specifically, with respect to ensuring that appropriate BPR assertions have been completed on all investments submitted for certification, the department reported that its BPR assessment team was unable to determine that sufficient BPR was conducted on 4 of the 12 systems reviewed. Accordingly, the team recommended that the Pre-Certification Authorities for each system ensure BPR compliance is assessed at the next milestone. However, though information on BPR compliance validations was provided at high-level, detailed information regarding all known weaknesses was not published in the March report to Congress. For example, the report did not disclose the names of the four systems for which the DBC review was unable to determine if appropriate BPR had been conducted."

For example, all subcontractor activities are now included in the core ground schedule and there is a higher percentage of activities allocated to individual resources in the spacecraft schedule. Overall, the primary schedules for the program&#39;s ground and flight project showed improvement in four and two best practices areas, respectively. In 2013, the program also identified further actions to ensure appropriate schedule logic, including monthly &#34;health checks&#34; and faster elimination of unnecessary constraints.
