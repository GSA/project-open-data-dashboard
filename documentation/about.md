# About

This website shows how Federal agencies are performing on the latest Open Data Policy ([M-13-13](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/)) using the guidance provided by [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.cio.gov/). It also provides many other other tools and resources to help agencies and other interested parties implement their open data programs. Features include:

- A [dashboard](../offices) to track the progress of agencies implementing Project Open Data on a quarterly basis
- Automated analysis of URLs provided within metadata to see if the links work as expected
- A [validator](../validate) for v1.0 and v1.1 of the Project Open Data Metadata Schema
- A [converter](../ciogov/csv_to_json) to transform CSV files into JSON as defined by the Project Open Data Metadata Schema
- An [export API](../export) to export from the CKAN API and transform the metadata into JSON as defined by the Project Open Data Metadata Schema
- A [changeset](../changeset) viewer to compare a data.json file to the metadata currently available in CKAN (eg catalog.data.gov)
