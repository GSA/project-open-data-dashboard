## The [Project Open Data Dashboard](http://labs.data.gov/dashboard/offices) is a website enabling Federal agencies, industry, and the general public and other stakeholders to view details on how Federal agencies are progressing on implementing [M-13-13 Open Data Policy—Managing Information as an Asset](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/). 

### Metrics 

The Project Open Data Dashboard is informed by [M-13-13](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/), the [Project Open Data Implementation Guide](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/implementation-guide/), the [Open Data Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal](http://www.performance.gov/node/3396/view?view=public#overview), and the [Integrated Data Collection](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-09.pdf) Open Data Progress, Use, and Impact questions. The Project Open Dashboard tracks progress in two ways:
 1.	Quarterly review by OMB staff of Leading Indicators in six categories: Enterprise Data Inventory, the Public Data Listing, Public Engagement, Privacy & Security, Human Capital, and Use & Impact. For more information see _Leading Indicators Strategy Rubric_.
 2.	Automated metrics determined by a script that analyzes [agency.gov] /data.json, /digitalstrategy.json, and /data files every 24 hours until the end of the quarter when a historic snapshot is generated. For more information see _[Documentation](./main)_.
