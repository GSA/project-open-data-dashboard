#Documentation

This is a guide to explain how the [Agency Dashboard](http://labs.data.gov/dashboard/offices) measures and tracks implementation of [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.com/). This website also provides a number of tools and resources to help agencies implement their open data programs and many of those are documented here as well.  

You can help [edit this documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/GSA/project-open-data-dashboard/edit/master/documentation/main.md). 

##Agency Dashboard

The [Agency Dashboard](http://labs.data.gov/dashboard/offices) is used to track how agencies are implementing [Project Open Data](http://project-open-data.github.com/) (aka [OMB M-13-13](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/)). This is done in two ways: 

1. Review of the [leading indicators](#leading_indicators) (detailed below) by OMB staff
2. [Automated metrics](#automated_metrics) that analyze machine readable files (eg, data.json, digitalstrategy.json)

The leading indicators are scored by OMB staff and they can involve a more subjective evaluation process. The indicators are also informed by the automated metrics which are generated by a daily automated script that analyzes files on agency websites to understand the progress and current status of their public data listings.

###Milestones

The dashboard is oriented around quarterly milestones. You can use  the blue milestone selection menu to navigate between milestones. The OMB scoring as well as the automated metrics are always tied to a specific milestone. The automated metrics will update every 24 hours until the end of the quarter when the milestone has been reached. At that point those automated metrics will represent a historical snapshot. To see the most current automated metrics, you'll need to view the current quarter (the next approaching milestone).

###Leading Indicators Strategy

The "Leading Indicators Strategy" refers to the five categories of indicators drawn from the [Cross Agency Priority Goals (CAP Goals) for Open Data](http://www.performance.gov/node/3396?view=public#overview). The strategies are based on the [Enterprise Data Inventory](#enterprise_data_inventory), the [Public Data Listing](#public_data_listing), [Public Engagement](#public_engagement), [Privacy & Security](#privacy_and_security), and [Human Capital](#human_capital) and are all detailed below.

###Doughnut Charts
There are three doughnut charts (a variation on a pie chart) displayed at the top of the Leading Indicators section. Each of these charts will only be displayed if the data is available.

#####Inventory Composition
This chart shows the `accessLevel` percentages in the Enterprise Data Inventory (*"public"*, *"restricted public"*, and *"non-public"*).

#####Public Dataset Status
This chart shows the percentage of public datasets (`"accessLevel":"public"`) that include a distribution with at least one `downloadURL` provided. A dataset without a distribution or a dataset that only includes a distribution with an indirect `accessURL` does not count as publishing a link to raw data. 

#####Dataset Link Quality
This chart shows percentages for [HTTP status codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) from the [total number of access and download links](#pdl_link_total). For more information on how these numbers are determined, see the [Quality Check Analysis](#quality_check_analysis) overview and the section for each status code linked below:

- [Working Links](#datajson_downloadable_2xx) *(HTTP 2xx)*
- [Redirected Links](#datajson_downloadable_3xx) *(HTTP 3xx)*
- [Broken links](#datajson_downloadable_4xx) *(HTTP 4xx)*
- [Error Links](#datajson_downloadable_5xx) *(HTTP 5xx)*
- [Unreachable Links (Other)](#datajson_downloadable_0) *(HTTP 0)*

*NOTE: The percentages for Error Links and Broken Links are currently mixed-up (swapped) in this chart. This should be fixed by April 17th 2015*
